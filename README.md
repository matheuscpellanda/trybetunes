In this project, an application was created capable of playing songs from the most celebrated bands and artists. It is also possible to create a list of favorite songs and edit the user's profile. This application will be able to:

- Log in with `username`
- Search by `band` or `artist`
- List available `albums` of a certain `band` or `artist`
- View `songs` from a selected `album`
- Play a `preview of songs` from this `album`
- Favorite and unfavorite songs
- View the list of `favorite` songs
- View the `profile` of the logged-in person
- Edit the `profile` of the logged-in person


## ðŸŽ› Linter

  To ensure code quality, `ESLint` and `StyleLint` were used. This way the code will be in line with good development practices, being more readable
  and easy to maintain!

  The following code was used to run the tests

  ```bash
    npm run lint
    npm run lint:styles
  ```


## ðŸ’» Prototype in Figma

  In addition to the quality of the code and compliance with the requirements, the project was executed following the proposed styling via Figma.
